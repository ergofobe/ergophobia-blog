Here is some content. Eleventy turns this Markdown into nice HTML.

The only sharing is the plain **Copy link** button below — readers decide what to do with it.

This is a third paragraph that should test the expand functionality. When you click "Show more", this entire post should be revealed inline.

And here's a fourth paragraph to make sure the expand logic works correctly. The post should show only the first two paragraphs initially, and then expand to show all content when the user clicks the button.

Finally, this is a fifth paragraph to ensure we have enough content to properly test the paragraph-based excerpt functionality.
