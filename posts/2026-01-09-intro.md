Hello and welcome!

If you’ve landed here, chances are you’ve felt the same quiet burnout I have with social media lately.

The endless noise. The spammers. The trolls. The reflexively negative pile-ons. The invisible algorithms that amplify outrage and bury everything else. I got tired of it.

So I built this place: **Ergophobia**.

A small, calm corner of the internet that belongs entirely to me. No character limits, no shadow-bans, no third-party moderation, no one else deciding what stays visible. Just me, my thoughts, and however many words it takes to say them.

That’s the feeling I’m after.

Everything I write will live here exclusively. No mirroring to the big platforms. No chasing likes, retweets, or impressions. Just writing, publishing, and letting the words sit quietly until someone finds them.

If anything I post resonates with you, feel free to share it. There’s a little copy-link button at the top of every article—grab the URL and drop it wherever conversations still happen the way you like: group chats, forums, your own feed, a newsletter, anywhere. The words are yours to carry.

Thanks for being here. 

I hope you find something worth your time.

More soon.
