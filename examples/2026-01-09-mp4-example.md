This is an example MP4 video post. The video file will be embedded using the HTML5 `<video>` tag.

You can replace the videoUrl with your own MP4 file hosted on your server or a CDN.

The `posterUrl` field in the front matter specifies the thumbnail/poster image that shows before the video plays. If not specified, the system will try to auto-detect by replacing `.mp4` with `.jpg` in the video URL.
