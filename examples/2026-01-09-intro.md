title: My First Neutral Post with a Very Long Title That Should Truncate with Ellipsis When It's Too Wide for the Available Space

Here is some content. Eleventy turns this Markdown into nice HTML.

The only sharing is the plain **Copy link** button below — readers decide what to do with it.

This is a third paragraph that should test the expand functionality. When you click "Show more", this entire post should be revealed inline.

Here's a video embedded in the middle of the content to show how videos can be included in regular article posts:

<div class="article-video-embed">
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

And here's a fourth paragraph to make sure the expand logic works correctly. The post should show only the first two paragraphs initially, and then expand to show all content when the user clicks the button.

Finally, this is a fifth paragraph to ensure we have enough content to properly test the paragraph-based excerpt functionality.
